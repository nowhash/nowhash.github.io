(Engg.) in Computer Science and Engineering from the International Islamic University Chittagong, Bangladesh in 2022. Currently, he is serving as a Junior Instructor in Computer Science at the Asian University for Women. His principal research interest includes opinion mining from informal social media data, measuring the informativeness of user-generated texts, deep learning technologies, computational linguistics, and natural language processing (NLP). However, he is always interested to explore other interdisciplinary research areas too. He published his research findings at two International conferences in India and Bangladesh. One of his recent articles was awarded the Best Paper Award at The 3rd International Conference on Innovations in Science, Engineering, and Technology (ICISET), IEEE, Bangladesh. Besides he received recognition for his excellent idea generation and software development skills at the National level Intra university Hackathon contest. He is very fond of learning and teaching programming languages. He has a great zeal to make a positive impact in the education, teaching, and research sectors. He is always passionate to help young students deepen their interest in learning and research.\n","date":1645833600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1645833600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Abu Nowhash Chowdhury received his B.Sc.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people are keen to share various information ranging from new cases, healthcare guidelines, medication, and vaccine news on Twitter. However, a major portion of the shared tweets is uninformative and misleading which may create mass panic. Hence, it is an important task to distinguish and label a COVID-19 tweet as informative or uninformative.","tags":["Informative Tweet Identification","COVID-19","Transformer Models","Document Embedding","Majority Voting"],"title":"Exploiting Diverse Contextual Features through Transformers for Detecting Informative Tweets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abu Nowhash Chowdhury","Shawon Guha","Nurul Amin","Shahidul Islam Khan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1639872000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639872000,"objectID":"d1657a38cd2a4a06fc78a287c2c84bcd","permalink":"https://nowhash.github.io/publication/indicon21/","publishdate":"2021-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/indicon21/","section":"publication","summary":"Microblogging platforms especially Twitter is considered as one of the prominent medium of getting user-generated information.
